1. This project contains index.html, which is the main page of my portfolio, resume.html, and bio.html. 
There are also CSS files for each of the HTML pages. I built a menu bar for each page that links to the
home page, my resume, and my biography. The website is not scalable, that is: viewed on a phone or tablet, 
it does not look good or the same as it does in a web browser on a computer. 

2. Jillian Howarth helped me redirect my site to the cs server and change the file permissions so that the
content is readable from my personal website. I used the Internet to research the best ways to do things
such as create a menu bar, make a CSS gradient, and change the color of the buttons when the user hovers over
them.

3. I spent approximately 7 hours on this assignment.
